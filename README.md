🌾 Smart Farming Crop Yield Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Smart Farming Application that predicts crop yield based on environmental and soil factors.
It uses Machine Learning (Random Forest) to analyze data like rainfall, temperature, humidity, and soil type, and then predicts the expected yield.

The solution is built for farmers and agricultural planners to optimize decision-making and improve crop productivity.

🚀 Features

✅ Predicts crop yield based on soil & weather conditions
✅ Web interface (Flask + HTML) for user-friendly input
✅ Machine Learning model trained on agricultural dataset
✅ Easy to deploy and extend with new data
